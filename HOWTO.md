# How to make an mtalk

This is a simple guide on how we normally do these mtalks
 

### Find a place to gather people

You can try to speak with Mindera *operations* in order to do that, usually we try:

- room 103 (mapfre)
- room 210 (mindera school)
- room 502 (lemon)

If you want to do a remote talk we usually use:

- Hangouts
- Zoom


### Some logistics if you schedule a room

#### Seats

Only **room 103** has chairs so if you think you will have more audience you can pick more in **room 116**

#### Projector

You can find one in **room 216**, or you can ask *operations*


### Notifications

Depending on your place and target you can notify people by:

- Google Calendar
- Slack
- Email (group lists eg: developers, operations, designers)

This is a template for announcing a mtalk
